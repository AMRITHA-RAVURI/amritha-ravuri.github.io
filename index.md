## PROJECTS

**Location Based Recomender System** *July 2017 - Jan 2018*
*(Major Project)*
- Implemented an algorithm for geographical-based recommender system which suggests an optimal path sequentially for a series of given pick-up points. 
- The problem of this sequential recommendation is to suggest a route connecting some pick-up points for a taxi driver so that he/she is more likely to get passengers with less travel cost. Used to dynamic-programming to overcome the challenge of high computational complexity due to larger number of pick-up points.
- Language: Python


**Emotional Analysis on Tweets** *Jan 2017 - May 2017*
*(Mini Project)*
- The aim of this project is to predict the emotion of a user analyzing his tweets. Python's NLTK package was used thoroughly for pre-processing the tweets and an NLP based technique was employed to analyze the emotions of the user.
- Language: Python
- Technique: NLP's n-grams technique
- Package: NLTK
