## EXPERIENCE
### FACTSET | SOFTWARE DEVELOPER ENGINEER 
*Jun, 2018 – Present* | *Hyderabad, Telangana*
- Actively working on development of Factset’s Screening tools.
- My major contributions include employing pdf and excel download of the reports, developing front-end for a new web-application using Vue.
- Feature enhancements like error-messaging, typeahead. 
- Improving the speed of the application by 48% using dynamic-routing of Webpack.
- Reducing the load time of opening a screen by reducing the number of requests of a specific type of call from O(n) to 1. Also, eliminating the redundant data transfer between the front-end and the middle-layer.
- Developed a tool that PD can use to fix some known client issues by automating the process by writing few SQL procedures which completely mitigated the Engineer's intervention. 
- As a team, we strictly adhere to the Agile scrum methodology. I'm currently mentoring the new-joinees in the team.
- I am also a part of the team developing a new Screening web-application from scratch.
- Technologies used: Vue, ASP.NET and othertools and libraries like Webpack and Jest for Unit-tests, C++ for backend services, SQL.

## PROJECTS

### Location Based Recomender System 
*July 2017 - Jan 2018* | *(Major Project)*
- Implemented an algorithm for geographical-based recommender system which suggests an optimal path sequentially for a series of given pick-up points. 
- The problem of this sequential recommendation is to suggest a route connecting some pick-up points for a taxi driver so that he/she is more likely to get passengers with less travel cost. Used to dynamic-programming to overcome the challenge of high computational complexity due to larger number of pick-up points.
- Language: Python


### Emotional Analysis on Tweets 
*Jan 2017 - May 2017* | *(Mini Project)*
- The aim of this project is to predict the emotion of a user analyzing his tweets. Python's NLTK package was used thoroughly for pre-processing the tweets and an NLP based technique was employed to analyze the emotions of the user.
- Language: Python
- Technique: NLP's n-grams technique
- Package: NLTK
